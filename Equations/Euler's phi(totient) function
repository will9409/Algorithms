In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.

It is written using the Greek letter phi as φ(n) or ϕ(n), and may also be called Euler's phi function. 

In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.

The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.

For example, the totatives of n = 9 are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8.

They are all relatively prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this range, 3, 6, and 9 are not, because gcd(9, 3) = gcd(9, 6) = 3 and

gcd(9, 9) = 9. Therefore, φ(9) = 6. As another example, φ(1) = 1 since for n = 1 the only integer in the range from 1 to n is 1 itself, 

and gcd(1, 1) = 1.

Euler's totient function is a multiplicative function, meaning that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime, then φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n).

This function gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n (the group of units of the ring ℤ/nℤ).

It is also used for defining the RSA encryption system. 



totatives 

In number theory, a totative of a given positive integer n is an integer k such that 0 < k ≤ n and k is coprime to n. 

Euler's totient function φ(n) counts the number of totatives of n. 

The totatives under multiplication modulo n form the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.
