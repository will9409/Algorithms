Recurrence relation
- An equation in which each term of the sequence is defined as a function of the preceding terms

- Example
  T(n) = T(n/2) + 1
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
  T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2)
  T(n) = T(n/2) + n
  
- Solutions
  1. Characteristic equation
  2. Repeated substitution of telescoping
  3. Master Theorem
