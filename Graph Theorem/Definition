Graph
- An abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links
- The interconnected objects are called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges

Graph G = (vertices V, edges E)

The type of a graph
- An undirected graph
  {v, w}  =  {w, v}
- A directed graph
  (v, W) !=  (w, v)
  
 
Representation of a graph
1. Edge list
  - A list of edges
  - available on many coding probles
ex) 0,1 (means that node 0,1 are connected)
    0,2
    0,3
    1,2
    
2. Adjacency matrix of G = (V, E)     - undirected
  - A two-dimensional n X n array: a[n][n]
  - a[i][j] = 1, if(vi, vj) is a element of E
  - a[i][j] = 0, if(vi, vj) is not a element of E
  
3. Adjacency matrix of G = (V, E)     - directed
  - A two-dimensional n X n array: a[n][n]
  - a[i][j] = 1, if<vi, vj> is element of E
  - a[i][j] = 0, if<vi, vj> is element of !E
  
4. Adjacency list of G = (V, E)       - directed, undirected
  - adjLists[n]
  - adjLists[i] is a pointer to the first node in the adjacency list for vertex i
 
 
 Performance
  - Sparse graph
    |V| = n
    |E| = O(n)
    
  - Dense(complete) graph
    |V| = n
    |E| = O(n^2)

Classification of graph algorithm   
Graph
- DFS
  1. Connected component              (undirected)
  2. Spanning tree                    (undirected)
  3. Biconnected component            (undirected)
  4. Strongly connected component     (directed) + Previsit & Postvisit, Types of edges, Directed acyclic graph
  
- BFS
  1. Single-source Shortest path      (direct weighted),(undirect weighted)
  2. All-pairs shorted path           (direct weighted),(undirect weighted)         
  
- Greedy
  1. prim                             (direct weighted),(undirect weighted)
  2. kruskal                          (direct weighted),(undirect weighted)
