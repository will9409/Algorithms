Graph
- An abstract representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links
- The interconnected objects are called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges

Graph G = (vertices V, edges E)

The type of a graph
- An undirected graph
  {v, w}  =  {w, v}
- A directed graph
  (v, W) !=  (w, v)
  
 
Representation of a graph
1. Edge list
  - A list of edges
  - available on many coding probles
ex) 0,1 (means that node 0,1 are connected)
    0,2
    0,3
    1,2
    
2. Adjacency matrix of G = (V, E)     - undirected
  - A two-dimensional n X n array: a[n][n]
  - a[i][j] = 1, if(vi, vj) is a element of E
  - a[i][j] = 0, if(vi, vj) is not a element of E
  
3. Adjacency matrix of G = (V, E)     - directed
  - A two-dimensional n X n array: a[n][n]
  - a[i][j] = 1, if<vi, vj> is element of E
  - a[i][j] = 0, if<vi, vj> is element of !E
  
4. Adjacency list of G = (V, E)       - directed, undirected
  - adjLists[n]
  - adjLists[i] is a pointer to the first node in the adjacency list for vertex i
 
 
 Performance
  - Sparse graph
    |V| = n
    |E| = O(n)
    
  - Dense(complete) graph
    |V| = n
    |E| = O(n^2)

 graph
component
 - it's called a connected componenet, of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to 
   each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph
connected
 - Two nodes u and v of a directed graph are connected if there is a path from u to v and vice versa

1.DFS
  - connected component (= component)
  In graph theory, a component, sometimes called a connected component, of an undirected graph is a subgraph 
  in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices 
  in the supergraph. For example, the graph shown in the illustration has three components. 
  A vertex with no incident edges is itself a component. A graph that is itself connected has exactly one component, 
  consisting of the whole graph. 

  - spanning tree
  In the mathematical field of graph theory, a spanning tree T of an undirected graph G is a subgraph 
  that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G, with minimum possible number of edges.
  In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree 
  (but see Spanning forests below). If all of the edges of G are also edges of a spanning tree T of G, then G is a tree 
  and is identical to T (that is, a tree has a unique spanning tree and it is itself). 

  - biconnected component
  In graph theory, a biconnected component (sometimes known as a 2-connected component) is a maximal biconnected subgraph. 
  Any connected graph decomposes into a tree of biconnected components called the block-cut tree of the graph. 
  The blocks are attached to each other at shared vertices called cut vertices or articulation points. 
  Specifically, a cut vertex is any vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components. 
  
  - strongly connected component
  In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected or diconnected 
  if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected components or diconnected components of 
  an arbitrary directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected. 
  It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, 
  in linear time (that is, Î˜(V+E)). 
     A. property : Every directed graph is a DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph) of its strongly connected compoenets
