Greedy algorithm
- The most straightforward design technique to solve a problem
  * n inputs
  * Requires to obtain a subset that satisfies some constraints
- An algorithm that works in stages, considering one input at a time

Terms
- Solution
  * A set of all imaginable methods to a given problem without considering the possibilities and feasibilities
- Constraints
  * physical considerations that restrict the set of solutions
- Feasible solution
  * Any subset that satisfies the constraints
- Objective function    (    ... -> optimal)
  * A set of functions that measure the satisfaction of the solution
  * The measurement can be either profit(to maximize) or cost(to minimize)
- Optimal solution
  * A feasible solution that optimizes(maximizes or minimizes) the objective function

Selection
- At each stage, a decision is made regarding whether or not a particular input is in an optimal solution
- Selection criteria is based on optimization measure
