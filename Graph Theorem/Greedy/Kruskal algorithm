1. Sort all the edges of a graph and list them in the ascending order of weights
2. Choose the edge of the minimum cost from the sorted list, and add it to the minimum cost tree T, if it doesn't make a cycle
3. Repeat this process until T has (n - 1) edges or the sorted list becomes empty

Performance analysis
1. Sorting edges : O( |E| log |E| )
2. Adding edges : O( |V| )
  2.1 Check cycles : O( |V| )
  
How to improve performances?
 - Use UNION-FIND operations for checking cycles
 - Assign labels on the vertices for UNION-FIND
   1. Forest-based implementation
   2. UNION -> O(1)
   3. FIND -> O(log n)
   
   
Another version of kruskal's algorithm
  - Checking cycles by labeling vertices
    If two vertices have same labels, then adding the edge that connects the two vertices becomea s cycle
