Minimum cost spanning tree
- computed on a weighted graph
- A spanning tree whose sum of edge weight is minimum
- Properties
  * No new edges
  * (n-1) edges for |V| = n
  * No cycle

Spanning tree
- Connecting every vertex of a graph G using minimum number of edges
- If |V| = n, then at least (n-1) edes are required
- Depth-first spanning tree
- Breadth-first spanning tree
