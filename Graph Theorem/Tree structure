Tree
  - Full binary tree
    -> A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. 
       Another way of defining a full binary tree is a recursive definition.
       A full binary tree is either:
         1. A single vetrex.
         2. A tree whose root node has two subtrees, both of which are full binary trees.
  
  - complete binary tree
    -> every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the
       last leve are as far left as possible.
       It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes at the last level h.
       An alternative definition is a perfect tree whose rightmost leaves have been removed.

  - perfect binary tree
    -> A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the
       same depth or same level.
       A prefect tree is always compelete but a complete tree is not necessarily perfect.

  - infinite complete binary tree
    -> Every node has two child (and so the set of levels is countably infinite).
       The set of all nodes is countably infinite, but the set of all infinite paths from
       the root is uncountable(?why?), having the cardinality of the continuum.
 
  - balanced binary tree
    -> A binary tree structure in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ 
       in height by no more than 1.
       One may also consider binary trees where no leaf is muche farther away from the root
       than any other leaf.

  - degenerate tree
    -> Pathological tree is where each parent node has only one associated child node.
       This means that the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.
